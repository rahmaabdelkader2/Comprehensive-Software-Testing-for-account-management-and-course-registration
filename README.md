### Overview:
This repository contains the full implementation of a software testing and validation project, designed to ensure the robustness and 
correctness of a software system through structured testing techniques. The system under test is an account management and course registration platform,
which handles various functions such as user account creation, login, password management, and course enrollment.

### Testing and Validation:
This project includes an extensive suite of tests designed to validate the functionality of the system:
- Unit Tests: Cover individual functions, ensuring the core logic works as expected.
- Compoenents Integration Tests: Validate interactions between different modules, such as user management and course registration.
- Boundary Value Testing: Ensures that edge cases are handled properly, such as age limits for different educational statuses.
- MC/DC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage): Ensures that each condition in logical decisions is tested to independently affect the outcome.
- State Transition Testing: Validates how the system transitions between different states (e.g., login/logout, course registration states).
